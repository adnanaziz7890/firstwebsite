          <h5>RNA clay offers green alternative to plant pesticides</h5>
          <p>
            A nano-sized bio-degradable clay comprising double stranded
            ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) could offer a cost-effective, clean and
            green alternative to chemical-based plant pesticides.
          </p>
          <p>
            Australian researchers from the University of Queensland have
            successfully used a gene-silencing spray, which they have named
            BioClay as it is a combination of biomolecules and clay, to protect
            tobacco plants from a virus for 20 days with a single application.
            Their study has been published in Nature Plants. “When BioClay is
            sprayed onto a plant, the virus specific dsRNA is slowly released
            from the clay nanosheets into the plant. This activates a pathway in
            the plant that is a natural defence mechanism. The dsRNA is chopped
            up into small bits of RNA by enzymes of this pathway. These small
            bits attack the virus when it infects the plant without altering the
            plant genome,” explains lead researcher, Neena Mitter.

            “Even with current pesticides, we lose up to 40 per cent of our crop
            productivity because of pests and pathogens. We are hoping that
            having BioClay in the mix as an environmentally friendly,
            sustainable crop protection measure will reduce crop losses,” Mitter
            adds. While chemical-based pesticides kill the targeted insect, they
            can also affect a range of other insects that are beneficial. Mitter
            says, “BioClay is specific and it only kills the pathogen being
            targeted. Currently farmers use insecticides to kill the vector that
            comes with the viruses, but with BioClay we can target the virus
            itself.”

            BioClay field trials may begin in Australia by year-end. “The first
            test will be on a virus that infects vegetable crops — capsicum,
            tomato, chilli,” Mitter tells SciDev.Net. Farmers can use the
            existing equipment to deliver BioClay and the researchers are
            hopeful that it will be a commercially viable product for farmers
            everywhere. The clay component is cheap to make, but not the RNA.
            Several companies like APSE, a US based startup, are working on the
            mass production of RNAs. APSE is developing RNA manufacturing
            technology for RNA interference (RNAi) or gene silencing
            applications. “Our technology for RNA production should be ready in
            2—3 years. We are targeting US$2 per gram,” APSE’s John Killmer
            tells SciDev.Net.

            Killmer says, “The clay-based delivery technology could represent a
            positive inflection point in the progress towards commercialisation
            of topical RNAi. This is a non-GM, environmentally benign and very
            specific technology.” RNAi technology is being used by many in the
            agriculture industry including the biotech firm Monsanto. The
            company’s BioDirect technology is focused on foliar applications of
            RNAi. Monsanto’s spokesperson John Combest tells SciDev.Net, “As
            insects develop resistance to certain classes of pesticides, giving
            farmers another option to control these pests is critical. The idea
            is not to replace any given system of farming, whether modern GM
            systems or others — it’s to provide farmers with products that can
            complement or replace agricultural chemical products.” This piece
            was produced by SciDev.Net’s South-East Asia & Pacific desk. This
            article was made possible with support from Monsanto.
