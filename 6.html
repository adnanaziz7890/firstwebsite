          <h5>Disruptive technologies’ transform Asian agriculture</h5>
          <p>
            Agriculture has historically depended on disruptive discoveries and
            innovations to make big strides.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 20th century, four innovations brought about change in
            agriculture: genetics (seeds), mechanisation, fertilisers and
            pesticides. These four innovations allowed more food, feed and fibre
            to be produced from less and less land. These innovations disrupted
            the status quo and created immense benefit to farmers and consumers.
            They fit what Clayton Christensen, a professor at the Harvard
            Business School, described in 1997 as a “disruptive technology” (DT)
            – one that displaces an established technology and shakes up the
            industry or a ground-breaking product that creates a completely new
            industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the re-discovery of Mendel’s laws of genetic inheritance,
            modern plant breeding had a scientific and empirical basis, and
            started to produce new crop varieties with higher potential yield in
            the 20th century and hybrid seeds became the major driver of
            increase in maize yield in the US. Indeed, maize yield increased
            seven-fold between 1940 to 2000 because of hybrid technology and
            enabled the world to have increased animal feed to meet the growing
            demands for animal protein especially in Asia. Hybrid maize may be
            considered as one of the first disruptive technologies in modern
            agriculture.

          <p>
            Asian agriculture faces many challenges that lend themselves to
            technological solutions. Food demand-side challenges are those that are
            linked to population growth, urbanisation and demographic change and
            shifting diets. Supply-side challenges are related to labour (ageing
            farmers, rural to urban migration), capital (increased uncertainties and
            reduced access), natural resources (reduced freshwater supplies, reduced
            arable land, climate change phenomena like severe weather events, droughts
            and floods) and technology (appropriateness, technology divide). While
            political and social solutions meet some of these challenges, experts
            generally agree that innovations, such as improved seed of new crop
            varieties, offer much potential. A perfect example of this is first “Green
            Revolution” which in the 1960s saw many large Asian countries increase
            yields with new rice and wheat varieties and agricultural inputs. China
            and India staved off mass starvation. If not for the positive impact of
            these disruptive innovations, Asia would not have had the food security
            necessary for economic development.
          </p>

            Admittedly, there have been instances where “Green Revolution”
            technologies have been over-zealously applied, resulting in over-use of
            pesticides and fertilisers, affecting the crop ecosystems they were
            supposed to benefit. These happened in countries like Indonesia and the
            Philippines where over-use of insecticides in the 1980s and 1990s led to
            massive outbreaks of a rice pest, the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata
            lugens). Research led by the International Rice Research Institute and the
            Food and Agriculture Organization, however, developed solutions through
            ecology-based Integrated Pest Management.
