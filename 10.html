            South-East Asia climate goals in doubt as upland clearing

            Forest clearance in South-East Asia, especially in the region’s
            higher-elevations, is giving rise to unusual increases in carbon
            emissions, says a new analysis based on high-resolution satellite
            data. South-East Asia, home to nearly 15 per cent of the world’s
            tropical forests, is a hotspot for deforestation and biodiversity
            loss, mostly due to the conversion of forests into palm oil and
            other plantations.

            Tree removal releases carbon stored in woody biomass into the
            atmosphere and limits the amount of carbon that can be sequestered
            and stored, explains Paul Elsen, co-author of the study published in
            Nature Sustainability. “Both of these processes increase net
            emissions,” he adds. The researchers from China, Thailand, UK and
            the US observed that forest clearance in the mountains of South-East
            Asia this century has accounted for a third of total forest loss in
            the region. “Our study revealed that forest clearing is much more
            widespread in South-East Asian mountains than previously thought,
            and that the rate of mountain forest clearing is increasing
            rapidly,” says Elsen.

            Elsen, climate adaptation scientist at the Wildlife Conservation
            Society, a non-governmental organisation based in New York, tells
            SciDev.Net that mountain forests have higher carbon densities than
            lowland forests in South-East Asia — which is why increased forest
            loss in the highlands has resulted in higher carbon emissions. Using
            satellite data, the researchers found that the total mean annual
            forest loss was 3.22 million hectares per year during 2001—2019,
            with 31 per cent occurring on the mountains. During that period, the
            average altitude of forest loss increased by 150 metres, according
            to the study, with an “unprecedented” annual forest carbon loss of
            424 million metric tonnes of carbon per year and an accelerating
            rate in recent years. By combining forest loss data with a forest
            biomass carbon map the researchers found carbon loss stemming from
            forest clearance was largely in the lowlands (e.g. in Indonesia).
            But a “decrease in lowland forest carbon loss” in the 2010s was
            offset by a substantial increase in forest carbon loss in the
            mountains (e.g. in Myanmar and Laos).

            a climate researcher at the Centre for Climate Change and
            Sustainability, Azim Premji University, Bangalore, India explains
            that forests help stabilise the climate, regulate ecosystems,
            protect biodiversity, and play an integral part in the carbon cycle,
            as well as supporting livelihoods and sustainable growth. However,
            “increasing urbanisation and food demands would mean the cutting
            down of more forests”, says Lakshmi Kumar, research assistant
            professor of atmospheric physics at the SRM Institute of Science and
            Technology, Kattankulathur, India.
