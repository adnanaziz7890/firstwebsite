          <h5>Despite clearing hurdle public can’t sample GM rice yet</h5>
          <p>
            While genetically modified Golden Rice has finally been cleared for
            commercial production in the Philippines, 20 years on from its
            inception, market availability is at least two years away,
            developers admit The Philippines last month became the first country
            to approve commercial production of Golden Rice, genetically
            engineered to have higher levels of beta-carotene, which the body
            converts to Vitamin A. Beta-carotene gives the rice a golden yellow
            colour, as it does fruits and vegetables like squash, papaya and
            carrots

            Ordonio adds that the seeds will be made available in target areas
            with a high prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency, by the last quarter
            of 2023. “Once sufficient seeds are available, Golden Rice will be
            deployed at a scale necessary to help address malnutrition,
            especially Vitamin A deficiency, in target provinces,” he says. A
            biosafety permit, issued on 21 July, certifies that the GM rice has
            “undergone satisfactory biosafety assessment” and can be propagated.
            The clearance comes two decades after the development of Golden Rice
            was first announced but was slowed down by technical difficulties
            particularly on yield issues, and opposition from anti-GM groups.

            According to WHO, Vitamin A deficiency is the world’s leading
            preventable cause of childhood blindness with up to 500,000 children
            falling victim to it each year, mostly in Africa and South-East
            Asia. Vitamin A deficiency puts children at increased risk of
            respiratory, diarrhoeal and other common infections besides causing
            slow bone development and stunting. It has been linked to pregnancy
            and lactation issues and higher maternal mortality rates. According
            to a 2020 report by the Philippines’ Food and Nutrition Research
            Institute (FNRI), children less than one year old had a higher
            Vitamin A deficiency prevalence compared to those between one and
            five years of age, and prevalence in rural areas was higher (19.5
            per cent) than those in urban areas (13.7 per cent).
