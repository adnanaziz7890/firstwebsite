          <h5>Biosafety fears behind Pakistan’s temporary ban on GM food</h5>
          <p>
            The Pakistan government would like to ensure that local maize
            varieties are not contaminated through cross-pollination by GM
            crops. Copyright: Image by WikiImages from Pixabay. This image has

            Pakistan is not opposed to genetically modified (GM) food crops but
            is concerned about biosafety, food security and potential health and
            environmental risks, say top officials, justifying a temporary ban
            ordered this month (July) on field trials and imports of GM
            maize.Syed Waseem-ul-Hassan, food commissioner at the Ministry of
            National Food Security and Research, tells SciDev.Net that the
            present government is not against GM crops but would like to ensure
            that local maize varieties are not contaminated through
            cross-pollination as various studies report.

            At present, there is hardly any need to introduce GM maize [that is
            being described as pest-resistant and high-yielding] into the
            country. Traditional maize varieties grown here are giving more than
            adequate yields of around four tons per hectare and there is no pest
            threat that necessitates allowing in GM maize,” the official says.
            ‘’The government is also interested in ensuring that farmers are not
            denied their collective right to have unimpeded access to seeds,’’
            he adds. There is a need to first develop ‘’effective regulatory
            frameworks” for GM food crops and ensure that they meet the same
            safety requirements as traditional foods, Shahid Mansoor, director
            of the National Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering,
            tells SciDev.Net.

            According to Khalid Mehmood Khokhar, president of Pakistan Kissan
            Ittehad, a farmers’ rights organisation, maize crop is
            wind-pollinated and GM maize can contaminate traditional maize crops
            within a five-kilometre radius. There are fears that once
            traditional crops are contaminated with GM maize through
            cross-pollination, farmers would become dependent on multinational
            corporations for seeds and other farm inputs. Khokhar says the
            experience with GM cotton crops has not been encouraging as farmers
            have continued to suffer major production losses since 2014 when
            planting with Monsanto’s GM cotton varieties first began. “The
            annual crop production has shown a constant declining trend from
            over 14 million bales to less than 10 million bales (each weighing
            170 kilograms),’’ he says.

            Zaigham Abbas Baloch, deputy director at the Pakistan Environmental
            Protection Agency (PEPA), tells SciDev.Net that the suspension is
            temporary but requires firms involved with the GM maize project to
            not engage in seed import, field trials, research activities and
            data sharing with any other organisation or academic institution
            until the country’s top leadership decides on the national policy on
            GM crops. The National Biosafety Committee, which is a part of PEPA,
            noted, at a meeting held earlier this year, that the cultivation of
            Monsanto Corporation’s GM cotton had not resulted in increased crop
            production or reduced pest resistance, Baloch tells SciDev.Net.
