          <h5></h5>Improving Asian buffalo breeds with genomics</h5>
          <p>
            Selective breeding of water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) and cattle with the
            help of genomics could help increase livestock productivity, thereby
            improving food security, nutrition and incomes for millions of smallholder
            farmers in Asia, says a new study. The researchers found that improvement
            via domestication in a species’ key traits, including milk production,
            coat colour, body size and disease resistance, leaves detectable signals
            in their genomes. This paves the way for improved farm animal health and
            production for smallholders through selective breeding.

            Now that we know the key genomic loci that are linked to important traits,
            it will be easier to target them in marker-assisted breeding to develop
            more productive breeds for local farmers," Prasun Dutta, co-lead author
            and research fellow at the Roslin Institute, tells SciDev.Net. “For
            example, we identified a genomic region linked to the differences in milk
            fat content observed between water buffalo breeds. Knowing this, it should
            be easier to develop breeds with a better milk fat content by targeting
            this locus,” says Dutta.
            Researchers compared the genomes of 79 water buffaloes across seven Indian
      breeds to those of 294 domestic cattle (Bos taurus taurus, Bos taurus
      indicus) genomes representing 13 breeds from across the globe, including
      Asia, Africa and Europe; and other domesticated species, such as dogs,
      from around the world. The study shows that characterising functional
      variants associated with desired traits in one species may provide
      potential candidates for introduction into other species. These findings

            Ordonio adds that the seeds will be made available in target areas
            with a high prevalence of Vitamin A deficiency, by the last quarter
            of 2023. “Once sufficient seeds are available, Golden Rice will be
            deployed at a scale necessary to help address malnutrition,
            especially Vitamin A deficiency, in target provinces,” he says. A
            biosafety permit, issued on 21 July, certifies that the GM rice has
            “undergone satisfactory biosafety assessment” and can be propagated.
            The clearance comes two decades after the development of Golden Rice
            was first announced but was slowed down by technical difficulties
            particularly on yield issues, and opposition from anti-GM groups.

            indicus) genomes representing 13 breeds from across the globe, including
            Asia, Africa and Europe; and other domesticated species, such as dogs,

            variants associated with desired traits in one species may provide
            potential candidates for introduction into other species. These findings
            have the potential to not only accelerate improved buffalo breeding
            programs using genomic approaches, but also show that some selective
            sweeps are relevant across diverse domesticated species. “Genes that are
            strongly linked to body size do seem to have been targeted by
            domestication across species. The genomic locations showing the biggest
            differences between cattle breeds were found to be most often linked to
            body size; loci linked to coat colour and milk traits were observed in the
            water buffalo analysis,” James Prendergast, a study author and senior
            research fellow at the Centre for Tropical Livestock Genetics and Health,
            tells SciDev.Net.

            “The DNA change that causes a black coat colour in German Shepherd dogs
            was also found in some water buffaloes, which have been selected for coat
            colour,” adds Prendergast. More smallholder farmers in Asia depend on
            buffaloes than any other domesticated species. Buffalo milk has twice the
            calorific content of cow’s milk and is rich in calcium and minerals. South
            Asia is home to most of the world’s 200 million water buffaloes, according
            to the Food and Agriculture Organization Statistical Database of 2017. The
            river buffalo is found primarily in India and the swamp buffalo in East
            Asia. Imports and migration have made water buffalo an important
            commercial source of milk production in the Middle East and Mediterranean
            countries.
