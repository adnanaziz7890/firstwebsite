          <h5>Golden Rice’s unfulfilled promise</h5>
          <p>
            In 2000, a Time magazine cover announced the sprouting of “Golden
            Rice”, promising to enhance nutrition for millions of
            poverty-stricken rice-eating Asians. The magazine showed the father
            of Golden Rice, Swiss plant researcher Ingo Potrykus, touting it as
            “rice that could save a million lives a year”. (1) A diet of Golden
            Rice — pale yellow because of genetically embedded beta carotene
            from which Vitamin A is made by the human body — could bring
            rice-eating consumers the gift of life and sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Golden Rice has come a long way since its proof-of-concept was
            featured in Time magazine in 2000, and we are excited to reach the
            last mile in our journey of making it available to those who need it
            the most,” Reinke tells SciDev.Net, without indicating a date by
            which it will be available to the public. Reynante Ordonio, Golden
            Rice project lead scientist at the Philippine Rice Research
            Institute (PhilRice), elaborates: “The Philippine Department of
            Agriculture-PhilRice has applied for commercialisation of Golden
            Rice and the application has been under final regulatory review in
            the Philippines since October 2020. It will only be made available
            to the public once it has received all necessary approvals.”

            Ordonio adds: “A successful application will enable the Philippine
            Department of Agriculture-PhilRice to proceed with the pilot-scale
            deployment of Golden Rice to selected communities and lay the
            groundwork for further research on its impact on Vitamin A intake
            and status.” But the way I look at it, the end is nowhere in sight.
            So why is it taking so long? More “pilot-scale deployment of Golden
            Rice to selected communities for further research” means years, even
            decades, of additional research. People and funding agencies now
            have a right to ask: how much longer and how many more millions of
            dollars will it take? Is the end worth it?
          </p>
          <p>
            It is true that most of the first years of Golden Rice research have
            been marked by the scientific difficulty of developing a new crop
            type, including the dilemma of low rice yields per hectare that make
            the variety unattractive for farmers to adopt. Known in agronomy as
            “yield drag”, i.e. GM rice doesn’t produce as much as non-GM
            varieties, a major reason why it has trouble getting approval. IRRI
            scientist Reinke explains that they are striving for that precisely.
            “The genes to produce beta-carotene in the grains are being
            introduced into a range of varieties with which farmers are
            familiar, produce good yields and are tolerant of stresses and
            diseases. “The genes are transferred into new varieties that have
            the same yield and growth characteristics as the original
            varieties.” Plant breeder and National Scientist Emil Javier, tells
            SciDev.Net: “It takes time to perfect the technology itself.
            Protracted steps are required by regulators for the release to the
            environment and consumption of a novel food product.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Another factor often cited for the delay in Golden Rice research has
            been opposition from anti-GM activists, including vandalism and
            court cases. Javier says that by using the courts, green lobby
            groups hit the research community where they are most vulnerable.
            Scientists can never say with certainty that any research is safe.
            But courts generally like to hear a yes or no. And strict
            regulations embodied in the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety also
            contribute to slow down the research.
