          <h5>GM tech expands with more crops to more countries</h5>
          <p>
            Recent developments in genetic modification (GM) technology include
            a way to prevent the popular Cavendish banana variety from being
            wiped out by the Fusarium wilt fungus, according to the latest
            report of the International Service for the Acquisition of
            Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA) released last week (29 August) in
            Manila.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Cavendish — which accounts for nearly half of all banana
            varieties grown in the world and most imports into Europe and the US
            — can be protected by splicing in genes from banana varieties
            resistant to the deadly Tropical Race 4 (TR4) strain of the Fusarium
            oxysporum fungus as well as a gene from a nematode worm, says the
            ISAAA report. First identified in Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia in
            the early 1990s, TR4 has since spread to Africa and now threatens
            the vast banana plantations of Latin America. Left unchecked, TR4
            may well cause the Cavendish to go extinct, threatening the
            livelihoods of 400 million people around the world who rely on this
            banana variety as food or as a source of income, according to FAO.

            Other recent developments in crop biotechnology listed in the report
            include GM sugarcane that is resistant to insects and drought, GM
            apples that do not turn brown, GM canola and safflower that have
            high levels of oleic acid which has anti-cancer properties.
            Similarly, GM potatoes do not bruise easily and, on deep frying,
            produce less acrylamide, a potentially cancer-causing chemical. GM
            potatoes are also resistant to late blight disease which caused the
            Irish potato famine in the 1840s and which continues to threaten
            potato crops worldwide. In his presentation, Paul Teng, ISAAA chair
            and senior fellow at the Southeast Asian Regional Centre for
            Graduate Study and Research in Agriculture, contended that since the
            first GM crops were planted 23 years ago, no ill effects have been
            documented; the crops have enjoyed an “unblemished and proven safety
            record” and have expanded 113-fold from 1.7 million hectares in 1996
            to 191.7 million hectares in 2018.
          </p>

            Teng said GM crops are “the fastest adopted crop technology in the
            world”, collectively earning some US$186.1 billion for countries
            that grew them from 1996 to 2016. “For 2017, the economic benefits
            were US$10 billion for developing countries and US$8.2 billion for
            industrial countries,” he said. In the Philippines, farmers earn
            US$76 million a year from planting GM yellow corn resistant to the
            corn borer. GM yellow corn, grown mostly by smallholder farmers,
            continues to make more money than rice, said Saturnina Halos,
            president of the Biotechnology Coalition of the Philippines.
            However, the adoption rates of the world’s top five GM crop-growing
            countries have reached close to saturation for some crops, Teng
            warned even as he pushed for the adoption of other GM crops and
            expansion to new areas such as in Africa.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the US, the average adoption rate for GM soybeans, corn and
            canola has reached 93.3 per cent. In Brazil, the adoption rate for
            GM soybean is 93 per cent; in Canada it is 92.5 per cent and close
            to 100 per cent in Argentina.
